                        I find that a healthy amount of curiosity can lead to new and exciting opportunities. 
                        It can produce the drive needed
                        to pursue new learnings, and continue growth; producing motivation to look for potential ways to contribute 
                        to an area of interest. 
                        Looking out of the immediate circle and taking a leap of faith out of the comfort detecting when a plateau had been reached with
                        repetitive tasks in an area.  I am a student and 
                        the pace at the UC Berkley Extension Data Analysis bootcamp is accelerated. There are lots of topics to cover. And although being the expert en either topic 
                        is not the objective, forming a good overall undertanding is an absolute target.
