                        I find that a healthy amount of curiosity can lead to new and exciting opportunities. 
                        It can produce the drive needed
                        to pursue new learnings, and continued growth; producing motivation to look for potential ways to contribute to an area of interest.

                  That curiosity led me to join the movement that is trying out an educational bootcamp and online immerged studies. 
On one hand, it's been a great experience to meet a group of like minded people and enjoy working towards the common goals set out by the program. On the other hand, the fast pace focused atmosphere keeps the momentum on learning. With an accelerated pace, jamming in a broad range of topics for a general understanding of current trends and technologies.
